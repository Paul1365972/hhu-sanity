# HHU Sanity Extensions
Browser extensions for the HHU websites to put me at ease.

Functionality split between two seperate extensions for now:

### HHU-Sanity-Ilias

- Auto redirects to ilias login page
- Auto logins when username/password fields are autofilled
    - You will need to click anywhere on the page to login (Because of browser security shenanigans)

### HHU-Sanity-PDF

- Opens (hopefully) all PDFs on HHU pages in the browser so your downloads folder doesn't fill with hundreds of badly named files
- Currenly uses manifest v2 (Scheduled to be removed on chrome in 2023), could work with v3, but that would remove the filename in case you do choose to download a PDF
